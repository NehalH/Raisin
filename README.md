# Raisin

Raisin is a command-line tool designed to compress text files using layered Huffman encoding techniques. It employs a layered approach, where the data is successively compressed at each layer, resulting in further reduction in size. Python is used as the programming language for the backend implementation.

## Features

- Compresses text files using layered Huffman encoding.
- Reduces the size of data while retaining the original content.
- Utilizes a binary string representation for efficient compression.
- Easy to use as a command-line tool.
